#Amazon Data Analyst Interview Question â€“ SQL Challenge 2 

In a recent Amazon data analyst interview, one of the candidates was given the following SQL challenge

Consider a retail business scenario where you need to identify customers who have made purchases exceeding $100. You have two tables called customers (containing customer_id and name) and orders (containing order_id, customer_id, and order_amount). The task is to join these tables and calculate the total purchase amount for each customer and select customers whose total purchase amount exceeds $100.

Code:

CREATE TABLE customers_table(
customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT not null);

CREATE TABLE orders_table(
order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id SERIAL not null REFERENCES customers_table(customer_id),
order_amount FLOAT);

INSERT INTO customers_table(customer_id,name)
VALUES (1,'Alice'),
       (2,'Bob'),
	   (3,'Charlie'),
	   (4,'David')
	   
select * from customers_table;

INSERT INTO orders_table(order_id,customer_id,order_amount)
VALUES (1,1,50.00),
(2,2,75.00),
(3,3,100.00),
(4,1,120.00),
(5,2,80.00),
(6,4,150.00)

select * from orders_table;

/*Join the tables and calculate total purchase amnt for each cus
and select customers whose total exceed 100*/

/* To verify the answer for the final*/
select c.customer_id,o.order_id,o.order_amount
from customers_table c
left join orders_table o
ON c.customer_id=o.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id

/*Final query*/
select c.customer_id,
sum(o.order_amount) as total_amount
from customers_table c
left join orders_table o
ON c.customer_id=o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING sum(o.order_amount)>100
ORDER BY c.customer_id
